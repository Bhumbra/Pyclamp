<!--l. 222--><p class="noindent" >Pyclamp can re-align episodes according the time-point of the maximum or minimum
waveform value of a selected channel over a specific time window. You must specify
the relevant channel in drop-down menu of the dialogue box and selected whether
you wish to align by the maximum or minimun value. If triggers marks are present,
you may also align on the basis of triggers. The length of excerpts of trace kept
before and after each point of alignment can be specified from the &#8216;Limit
per-alignment window&#8217; drop-down. Pyclamp also allows you to set triggers by the
point of alignment within each episode. Following the dialogue box, a vertical cursor
will appear for the selected channel and you must indicate the region for
maximum/minimum/trigger detection using two left mouse clicks. Note that all other
channels will be aligned accordingly. If you align by triggers, the number of
resulting episodes will correspond to the number of triggers in the specified
region; this will eliminate episodes of the original data with no triggers in the
specified region or give rise to overlapping episodes in cases in which there
is more than one trigger in the specified region. Note that all alignment
procedures automatically detect coincidental (fully overlapping) episodes and
eliminate duplicates. This can be useful for removing multiple-triggering
events.
