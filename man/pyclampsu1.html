<!--l. 96--><p class="noindent" >For waveform analysis, Pyclamp can read gap-free and episodic old- and new- ABF
(Axon) files. There&#8217;s also experimental support for CED&#8217;s SMR waveform
and wavemark data, SES&#8217;s WinEDR/WinWCP formats, and raw binary
(SMRX-readability might be accommodated in future). You may or may not notice
more than one file listed in the listbox at the top of the dialogue box. This is an
experimental feature that enables contatentation of waveform files that appear to
have potentially identical protocols.
<!--l. 102--><p class="indent" >   Presently, Pyclamp requires one pair of channels to be selected: one passive and
one active. These are specified by the user in the &#8216;Channel Selection&#8217; part of the &#8216;File
and channel selection&#8217; dialogue box. The passive channel should contain the recorded
waveform data for the evoked synaptic responses. The active channel may comprise
of monitored applied voltage/current data, or the activity of a pre-synaptic cell in the
case of a pair recording. Note that the user may specify the same channel for the
passive and active fields.
<!--l. 108--><p class="indent" >   If you open a single channel file, the active and passive channel must be the
same. If the waveform file contains more than two channels, then you are
strongly advised to turn additional passive/active pairs off using the drop-down
menus, unless your computer has vast RAM and graphics RAM. The &#8216;Channel

Information&#8217; part of the dialogue box lists for each the channel the sampling
interval, gain, and offset. Note that the values can be changed at this stage
in case they are incorrect. Following this dialogue box is another in which
you are prompted to specify the clamp and configuration of the passive
channel.
