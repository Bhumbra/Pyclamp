<!--l. 398--><p class="noindent" >Before running Bayesian quantal analysis (BQA), you are prompted to choose the
settings for the calculations using a dialogue box. The &#8216;Data selection&#8217; allows
deselection and reselection of data sets used for quantal analysis. Note that a
minimum of two data sets are required. The remainder of the dialogue box
allows the user the customise the nature and precision of the analysis. It
makes mathematical sense to make the probability of release to be at a
resolution higher than any of the other parameters. In general, 128 is enough.
The resolution for the coefficient of variation and certainly the number of
release sites should be less or equal to the resolution of the probability of
release.
<!--l. 405--><p class="indent" >   Most critical is specification of the maximum number of release sites. Of course
this is dependent on the relevant biological system, but an upper bound
should be known. If the value specified is too small, then BQA will be forced
into underestimating the number of release sites. An inappropriate high
value however comes at the cost of reducing precision of calculation and
computational time. In practice, it is best to enter a realistic maximum. Due to the
discrete nature of the number of release sites, the ideal maximum of number of
release sites fulfils the condition: any integer <span 
class="cmsy-10">* </span>(<span 
class="cmmi-10">N </span><span 
class="cmsy-10">- </span>1) + 1, where <span 
class="cmmi-10">N </span>is the
resolution sampling the number of release sites. By default the program uses
Jeffrey&#8217;s rule to assume a reciprocal prior for the number of release sites (you&#8217;ll
need to read about this if you&#8217;re a bit fuzzy on what this means) but the
program gives you the option of assuming a flat prior by unchecking this
radiobutton.
<!--l. 415--><p class="indent" >   For all parameters, a greater resolution improves precision but at the cost of
computational time and memory. The heterogeneity sampling resolution defaults to a
value 1, which indicates to Pyclamp that the BQA model specification assumes
identical release probabilities across all release sites. If you enter a greater integer
value, the BQA algorithm will assume heterogeneous release probabilies
according to a beta model and sample the parameter <span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x03B1; </span>by the specified
resolution.
<!--l. 421--><p class="indent" >   If you model heterogeneous release probabilities beware of two possible issues.
The first is simply a matter of sampling resolution. An additional continuous
parameter adds another dimension to an already multi-dimensional matrix.
Consequently, you should try to select a low sampling resolution (<span 
class="cmti-10">e.g. </span>12) for <span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x03B1; </span>and
consider dropping the sampling resolution for the coefficient of variation to a similar
figure. The second issue is the exponential matrix growth evaluating heterogeneous
release probabilities as the maximum number of release sites increases. Since the
minimum size of the matrix is 2<sup><span 
class="cmmi-7">n</span></sup>, where <span 
class="cmmi-10">n </span>is the number of release sites, the time

taken also exponentially grows. While this is trivial for low values of <span 
class="cmmi-10">n</span>, the cost of
the numerical operations can become substantial once <span 
class="cmmi-10">n </span>reaches the high
teens.
