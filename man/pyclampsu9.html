<!--l. 246--><p class="noindent" >The above functions are provided (with other more experimental ones) in the
&#8216;Process&#8217; menu. The &#8216;Selection&#8217; menu is useful for selecting individual events that can
be marked for &#8216;deletion&#8217; to remove unwanted events or set to &#8216;active&#8217; or &#8216;inactive&#8217;, for
example if you to flag events as being &#8216;successes&#8217; as distinct from &#8216;failure&#8217; when it
comes to outputting tabulated results. More sophisticated methods of selection are
provided by a subapplication that can discriminate in 2 or 6 dimesions. The
subapplication is still very much in its infancy. While it is far from completed, you
can make use of some of its functionality. The discriminator is a descendent of
similar programs designed to isolate action potentials called SpikeLab and
LabSpike (for details see Bhumbra, Inyushkin, and Dyball (2004) J. Neuroendo.
16:390-397)
<!--l. 255--><p class="indent" >   From the dialogue box, you have to select the channel you wish to use for
discrimination. Using two left mouse clicks to position vertical cursors, you must
specify the region of the episodes to be used for the purposes of discrimination.
Pyclamp will then calculate a number of parameters that characterise the
waveform shape in the specified window of each episode for the selected channel.
Depending on the amount of data, these parameters may take some time to
evaluate.
<!--l. 260--><p class="indent" >   After the shape parameters are calculated, you will be presented with either one
or three scatter plots on two waveform plots. In the case of a single plot, you simply
discriminate using the ellipse with each episode represented as a dot. Each
ellipsesand be moved by its edges or reshaped by dragging one of the two
anchors on their major or minor axes. By manouvring the ellipses, you can
&#8216;cluster-cut&#8217; signal from noise. Right-clicking an ellipse restores it to its original
position.
<!--l. 266--><p class="indent" >   For 6D discrimination, dots are coloured-coded according to whether they lie
inside or outside the three ellipses. The inside/outside colouring can be reversed by
clicking the middle-mouse button for the relevant display. Dots are coloured logically
according to the Boolean logic for all three ellipses:

<!--l. 281--><p class="indent" >   Note that individual dots can selected and the corresponding trace is shown in the
bottom left panel. Below this panel are buttons that indicate the numbers of dots
correspond to each colour. All traces corresponding to a given colour can be
overlayed by clicking on the button of the appropriate colour in the button panel
below. Note that the episodes can be deleted or undeleted by pressing the &#8216;delete&#8217; or
&#8216;insert&#8217; button respectively.
<!--l. 286--><p class="indent" >   The panel in the bottom right overlays &#8216;accepted&#8217; traces according whether a
given colour is &#8216;On&#8217; or &#8216;Off&#8217;. You can toggle the accept-state of a colour by clicking
on the button of the appropriate colour in the button panel below. Note that in
addition to the accepted traces, the selected traces shown in left panel are also
overlayed on the right except in a highlighted colour. Finally, the total number
of accepted traces is shown on the bottom right button and you can click
here to complete the discrimination. Note that any episodes deleted in the
discrimination window are deleted irreversibly once you leave this screen.
The only way the deleted episodes can be returned to the data set is by
clicking on &#8216;Restore&#8217;, but this will also lose any discrimination you have
performed.
